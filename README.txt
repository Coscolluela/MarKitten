Markitten is a Customer Relationship Management System that goes hand in hand with CATalog, a Product Catalog System. Specifically, Markitten allows customers to view and manage their personal information and subscribe to a monthly catalog of products and reviews. It serves as a platform not only for customers to personalize their profiles but also for the system admin, Customer Relationship Manager, to oversee customer information.
